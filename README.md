# **Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?**

For the project A company named Creative Technology Solutions wanted us to change their Android app the Gaming Room into a full-service web-based game. The game itself is based on a 1980s television game. Each game is meant to have one or more teams. Each team will have multiple players and they should be able to fully work online. The main program requirements were to make sure that the game could have one instance of a player at a time as well as having one instance of a game that can exist in the memory at a time. So based on these requirements we designed the code to where it will be a Singleton instance for the game and each player, team and game have to have their unique names as well. The process included the use of some iterative patterns so that going through the data structures would be fast and wouldn't intrude on any of the underlying code. Java was used as the primary coding/programming language and since the game was web-based we used Drop Wizard as the open-source framework to use the Jersey API to develop a RESTful program incorporating Client-Server architecture.




# **What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?**
Even though the project was difficult  I believe that I did particularly well with the design constraints that were needed for the program to run and documenting and describing them.
What about the process of working through a design document did you found helpful when developing the code?
The process of developing the design document while coding had been easy to break down and understand the reason for every consideration and it made describing parts of the document easier. 
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I could revise a piece of the documents it would be the Recommendations. I had completely forgotten that even though Linux and MacOS had major learning curves Linux especially has been growing ever more popular and therefore employees would be able to use both. If I could change anything or improve it I think I would switch my recommendation from Windows to Linux as it may offer better protection and versatility.

# **How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**
The app is needed for multiple users on various devices and OS systems so the software had to be designed to accommodate the users. By developing the software document and weighing the options of what was needed based on the requests of the client it made making the design document easier than I thought.

# **How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?**

Software design documents are essential for building apps and the Software development lifecycle so I think in the future if I were to build an app like this I would try to weigh the options of the systems needed first before developing code to get an accurate representation of what the customer needs. In addition, using Drop Wizard had been a little complicated at first but after Going through the steps one by one it seemed to become easier to understand so I think I would also incorporate it into developing apps again. For parts of the design document, I did it while I worked on the code and did some parts sporadically without considering the full effect of what I wanted to do with the app so in the future, I definitely will go into designing any code with all the software and hardware considerations in mind.
